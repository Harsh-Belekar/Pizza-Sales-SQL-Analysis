# 🍕 Pizza Sales SQL Analysis  

This project demonstrates my ability to perform **end-to-end SQL data analysis** on real-world sales data.  
Using **PostgreSQL**, I designed the database schema, imported raw CSV files, and wrote queries to answer **business-driven questions** ranging from simple sales reporting to advanced insights using **CTEs, subqueries, and window functions**.  

The analysis highlights not just technical SQL skills but also the ability to extract **actionable business insights** — the kind of analysis companies use to understand sales performance, customer behavior, and revenue drivers.

## 🗂️ Database Schema  

The database is designed with four tables: **pizzas, pizza_types, orders, and order_details**.  
This schema ensures normalized relationships between orders, pizzas, and pizza categories.

## 🚀 How to Reproduce  

1. Run **`create_table_query.txt`** to create the database schema  
2. Import CSVs from **`Pizza_sales_csv.zip`** into PostgreSQL  
3. Solve questions from **`Questions.txt`**  
4. Compare results with **`Answer.sql`**

## 📸 Sample Output  
![Top 3 Pizzas](images/top_pizzas.png)  
*Figure: Top 3 pizzas in each Category by revenue contribution*

#### Query
```sql 
--4.Identify the top 3 pizza types contributing the most to revenue in each category.
WITH ranked_pizzas AS (
	SELECT pt.category, pt.name,
	SUM(p.price * od.quantity) AS total_revenue,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY pt.category 
		ORDER BY SUM(p.price * od.quantity) DESC) AS rank_within_category
	FROM order_details od
	JOIN pizzas p ON od.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
	JOIN pizza_types pt ON p.pizza_type_id = pt.pizza_type_id
	GROUP BY pt.category, pt.name
)
SELECT rp.category, rp.name, rp.total_revenue
FROM ranked_pizzas rp
WHERE rp.rank_within_category <= 3;
```
